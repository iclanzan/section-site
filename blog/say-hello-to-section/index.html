But I did not make Section just for the love of it. I wanted to create something special.</p><p>It is 1:40 AM at my end as I am writing this and to be honest I’m physically exhausted but desperate to release Section into the wild.</p><p>About a year ago I started using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> as a build tool for a sweet single page app I’m developing called <a href="http://songpane.com/">SongPane</a> when this great idea came to me—building a static site generator on top of Grunt. It is only for the past week or so that I found the time to hack it together and it is only because I found myself needing it.</p><p>The idea behind Section is to be able to generate websites from nothing more than markdown files—No configuration files, no front-matter or anything like that. The site and permalink structure is dictated by the way markdown files are organized in the working directory.</p><p>The project is at an early stage, but I see a lot of potential in it and would love to see people getting involved. So, by any means tell me what you think!</p></section><footer><section><p class=center><a class=section title="Built with section v0.4.1" href="http://section.iclanzan.com"><span></span><strong>Section</strong></a></p></section></footer></main><script>
