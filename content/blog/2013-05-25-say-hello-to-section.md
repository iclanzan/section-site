# Say hello to Section

I love static site generators so much I just had to make one. But I did not make Section just for the love of it. I wanted to create something special.

It is 1:40 AM at my end as I am writing this and to be honest I’m physically exhausted but desperate to release Section into the wild.

About a year ago I started using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) as a build tool for a sweet single page app I‘m developing called [SongPane](http://songpane.com/) when this great idea came to me—building a static site generator on top of Grunt. It is only for the past week or so that I found the time to hack it together and it is only because I found myself needing it.

The idea behind Section is to be able to generate websites from nothing more than markdown files—No configuration files, no front-matter or anything like that. The site and permalink structure is dictated by the way markdown files are organized in the working directory.

The project is at an early stage, but I see a lot of potential in it and would love to see people getting involved. So, by any means tell me what you think!
