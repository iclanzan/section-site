# Section

Turn plain text files into beautiful websites in a heartbeat. Section is perfect for creating blogs and documentation sites.

### Unsophisticated
Section strives to make it easy to prepare your content to be published on the internet. You don’t have to fiddle with configuration files if you don’t want to. Section is all about concentrating on what’s important—**your content**.

### Attractive
Websites generated by Section are **plain**, but **beautiful**. The aesthetic side is fashioned in such a way as to complement your words. Wonder how a Section site looks like? You are reading one right now!

### Unconstraining
In another word, Section is **open**. You are granted the freedom to use, alter, customize and improve it. You have the possibility of growing it into something more magical, more robust, more **fulfilling**.

## Getting started

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you don’t already have it, then in your terminal:

```
~ $ npm install -g section
~ $ mkdir -p mysite/content
~ $ cd mysite
mysite $ echo '#Hello World!' > content/index.md
mysite $ section
```

Now if you point your browser at `http://localhost:8000` you should see your newly created website and each time you change a file the website is regenerated automatically.

Section takes a directory of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents and generates a static website ready to be served on the web.
